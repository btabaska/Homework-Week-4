# Javascript Code Quiz

## Intro

This is a Javascript code quiz. It is set up to put your skills in Javascript to the test by asking you a series of up to 20 questions. The twist is that you only have 2 minutes to answer all of them before time is up! If you get a question right you will earn 5 points towards your total, however if you get one wrong you lose 10 seconds off the clock.
